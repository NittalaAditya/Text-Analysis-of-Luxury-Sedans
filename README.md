# Text-Analysis-of-Luxury-Sedans
Competitive analysis of the entry level luxury car market in the USA

# Task A
* We have written a scraper to fetch around 5000 posts about cars from the Entry Level Luxury forum https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performance-sedans
The idea is to have multiple brands and models being discussed without one of them being the focal point. So we have chosen the more recent posts

# Task B
* Once we fetched the data, we tested if the data support Zipfâ€™s law econometrically. Zipf law states that the rank of the word is inversely proportional to it's frequency.

# Task C
* Calculated lift ratios for associations between the top-10 brands identified in Task A.

# Task D
* Showed the brands on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map 

# Task E
* Some insights from our analyses in Tasks C and D 

# Task F: 
Answered questions like : 
* What are 5 most frequently mentioned attributes or features of cars in the discussions? 
*Which attributes are most strongly associated with which of these 5 brands?

# Task G: 
Insights from Task F

# Task H: 
Found out which is the most aspirational brand and it's business implications in our data in terms of people actually wanting to buy or own.
